@venkatkkd and anyway, the bjp have made their stand clear on 377. they are for it. end of story. #sec377
so, is @ram_guha finally out of the closet? that he detests not just modi, but even bjp and its governments? http://t.co/2lk3p4wzuj

@minhazmerchant it is the anti-bjp media thru wch spokespersons' views are conveyed to the general public. that being so....(1)
first thing bjp should do after coming to power is stop conversions and free temples and ask priests to start reconversions.
rt @crguna: congress and bjp are guilty of both 1984 and 2002 jointly and severally @pavank_varma @hs1984pbi
@bloombergtvind nope. this is just posturing. happens before all elections. shiv sena is posturing with bjp in the same way
@waglenikhil why you aaps always club congi and bjp,  whereas aap does close door meeting with them, take their support and flirt with them
aap should realize that people judge it by much higher standard than congress or bjp and that is right thing to do.
@sardesairajdeep nobody in bjp dares to tell the truth to this day dreamer. if u search optimism in google it asks "did u mean advani?"
@minhazmerchant ....we need to factor in d bhaandmedia's hostile attitude 2 bjp, in our assessment of the spokespersons' effectiveness. (2)

there is a huge difference among senior leader of bjp, as soon as distribution of ticket all dissatisfaction came, bjp will lost it identity
@india272 bjp should never ally with this drunkards' party
@manhas4890 tumhe pata bhi hai cong/bjp ke fund me isi ke paise invested hai. thats why they scared to disclose the name of donors.
a good work for lok sabha elections and a solid base for assembly elections is being made by bjp unit of west bengal &amp; @varungandhi80 .
@vishaldadlani dude bjp scrutiny is already done n highest court unless u want to try them in kangaroo courts
if the bjp cannot make the next govt, they are going to look very very stupid for creating such songs. hahahahaha! https://t.co/iasughahfd
@minhazmerchant till the political right creates a pro-right space in the media, bjp spokespersons will continue to be hobbled. (3)

@sarkar_swati :) it is just keep them off to control further damage! goel at least. if bjp heard @madhukishwar advise bjp wud hv been in pwr
@iswets @dna ha ! i am not bjp
@bjprajnathsingh bjp's empowerment scheme promises them employment so they can live with dignity and do not depend at the mercy of govt.
@sambitswaraj in budget session, congress must be having something similar to offer this time too. look sharp bjp people.
@timesnow @incindia @rahulgandhi4you @rahulgandhisupp very well said smriti....rahul is a challenge to his party not bjp.he is dumb no doubt
